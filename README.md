# TensorFlop
An assembly replication of TensorFlow.
Use Kras, Keras analogue to use TensorFlop, add layers, compile, fit and enjoy your useless CNN.

Single threaded and badly optimised, TensorFlop will help you daily in most of your work tasks.

Use Kras by importing the Kras file, make sure to use NASM, Linux, 64 bits device, and link with GNU linker.
